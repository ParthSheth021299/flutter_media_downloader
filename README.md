## Android integration

You just need to add permissions in your manifest file for the push notification. And other permission for read external storage.
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS" />
```

### Open downloaded file from notification

To make tapping on notification open the downloaded file on Android, add the
following code to `AndroidManifest.xml`:

```xml
<provider
    android:name="androidx.core.content.FileProvider"
    android:authorities="${applicationId}.provider"
    android:exported="false"
    android:grantUriPermissions="true">
    <meta-data
        android:name="android.support.FILE_PROVIDER_PATHS"
        android:resource="@xml/provider_paths" />
</provider>
```

**Notes**

- Here in this plugin for iOS device when media file is downloaded then it is open and from there you can store wherever you wan to store.
